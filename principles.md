# Seb's principles

**Why have principles?**

As Ray Dalio explains in his book *[Principles](http://principles.com):*

> Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior…They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.



**Here are mine...**

------

### Don’t take things too seriously! 

### You cannot control* life

- Life has a certain flow to it. If you are willing to tap into the flow, you will be able to ride the flow. Resist the flow and you find yourself struggling
- Be patient and trust life

### Take a breath

- Remember to breath
- Slow down
- Reflect

### Embrace reality and deal with it

- Don’t get hung up on how things should be, because she will miss out on learning how they really are
- Evolve or die
- Pain plus reflection equals progress
- Look at the machine from a higher level

### Be radically open-minded

- You might not know the best possible path
- Listen without judging or helping
- Recognize close-mindedness when you see it

### Understand that people are wired differently

- Introvert vs. extrovert, planning vs. perceiving, etc.

### Start small

- Use the 80/20 rule and know what the 20% are
- be an imperfectionist

### Make decisions effectively (and don’t look back)

- Simplify!
- Use your principles

(*) From an evolutionary standpoint, if we are in control of our environment, then we have a far better chance of survival. Our deep subconscious mind thus gives us strong biochemical prods when we face some kind of danger (such as the fight-or-flight reaction) 

Other needs that lead to a sense of control include:

- A sense of certainty
- Completion of outstanding things, so we don't have to worry about them
- Understanding of how things work.
- Being able to predict what will happen
- That people (including ourselves) and things are consistent.
